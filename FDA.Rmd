-> Columns/Variables:

       TV: Advertising spending on TV.
    
       Radio: Advertising spending on radio.
    
       Newspaper: Advertising spending on newspaper.
    
       Sales: The target variable, representing product or service sales.
       
-> Number of Instances:

       200 



```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/SRIDHAR/Desktop/fall sem 23-24/FDA/DA/advertising.csv")
column_names <- colnames(data)
print(column_names)

```


```{r}
num_instances <- nrow(data)
print(num_instances)

```

## Correlation Analysis:

Use ggplot to visualize the relationships between different features in your dataset (advertising spends) and the target variable (sales). Perform a correlation analysis to identify which features are most strongly correlated with sales.

```{r}
# Load the ggplot2 library if not already loaded
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate the correlation coefficients
correlation_matrix <- cor(data[, c("TV", "Radio", "Newspaper", "Sales")])

# Convert the correlation matrix to a data frame for ggplot2
# We convert the correlation matrix to a data frame using as.data.frame(as.table(correlation_matrix)), which allows us to use the Var1, Var2, and Freq columns for aesthetics in the ggplot2 code.

correlation_df <- as.data.frame(as.table(correlation_matrix))

# Create a ggplot2 correlation plot
# We use aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = Freq) to specify the aesthetics for the ggplot2 heatmap.
correlation_plot <- ggplot(data = correlation_df, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap",
       x = "Features",
       y = "Features",
       fill = "Correlation")

# Print the correlation plot
print(correlation_plot)

```



```{r}
# Identify the features most strongly correlated with Sales
correlation_with_sales <- correlation_matrix["Sales", c("TV", "Radio", "Newspaper")]
cat("Correlation with Sales:\n")
print(correlation_with_sales)
```

INFERENCE:

TV has a strong positive correlation with Sales (0.9012). This suggests that as spending on TV advertising increases, Sales tend to increase as well.

Radio also has a positive correlation with Sales, but it is not as strong (0.3496) as the correlation with TV. This indicates that Radio advertising spending is positively related to Sales but to a lesser extent than TV advertising.

Newspaper has the lowest correlation with Sales (0.1579). It still shows a positive correlation, but it is weaker compared to both TV and Radio.

In summary, TV advertising spending is the feature most strongly correlated with Sales, suggesting that it has the strongest linear relationship with Sales among the three advertising channels.

## Model Development: 

Choosing Linear Regression as the machine learning algorithm for developing a predictive model in the domain of Marketing Analytics to estimate sales based on advertising spend across multiple channels is a reasonable choice.

Justification for Using Linear Regression:

-> Interpretability:

Linear Regression provides straightforward interpretability of the model's coefficients. In marketing analytics, interpretability is often crucial because it allows marketers to understand the direct impact of advertising spend on sales for each channel.

-> Linearity Assumption:

Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictors (advertising spend in various channels) and the target variable (sales). While this assumption may not hold in all cases, it often provides a good starting point for modeling marketing data, where linear relationships are plausible for certain advertising channels.

-> Simplicity:

Linear Regression is a simple and easy-to-implement model. It can serve as a baseline model for comparison with more complex algorithms, helping identify whether a linear model adequately captures the relationship or if a more sophisticated approach is necessary.

-> Speed and Efficiency:

Linear Regression is computationally efficient and can handle relatively large datasets, making it practical for real-time or batch predictions in marketing scenarios.

Training and Evaluation of the Linear Regression Model:

-> Data Preparation:

The dataset should include historical data on sales and advertising spend across multiple channels, as well as any relevant features or factors that may impact sales.
Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling, should be performed.

-> Data Splitting: 

Divide your dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing (or validation) set. A common split is 70-80% for training and the remaining 20-30% for testing.

-> Feature Engineering:

Engineer relevant features that capture the advertising spend for each channel. For instance, create separate features for spend on online display ads, social media advertising, email marketing, etc.
Consider adding time-based features to capture seasonality and trends.

-> Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set should include historical data, while the testing set should encompass more recent data for evaluation.
Train the Linear Regression model using the training data, where the advertising spend features (channels) are used as predictors, and sales are the target variable.


```{r}
# Assuming your data frame is named 'data'
model <- lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper, data = data)
model_summary <- summary(model)
print(model_summary)

```
```{r}
m1 <- lm(Sales ~ TV*Radio*Newspaper, data=data)
m2 <- lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio, data=data)
m3 <- lm(Sales ~ TV*Radio, data=data)

library(stargazer)
stargazer(m1,m2,m3, title = "The Three Models Summary", type="text")
```
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(m1)
plot(m2)
plot(m3)
```
# 1. Linear Relationship
The assumption can be checked by the "Residuals vs Fitted" plot (the 1st plot in the diagnostic plots). The ideal plot shows no residuals patten, with the red line approximately horizontal at zero.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(m1,1)
plot(m2,1)
plot(m3,1)
```
Within the 3 models, the model 2 - the middle has a red line horizontally aligned at zero.

# 2. Independence

To check independence, I use Durbin-Watson's d tests When null hypothesis, residuals are not linearly auto-correlated. We confirm by the DW value between 1.5 and 2.5 for no autocorrelation.

As a result, all models' assumption is met by DW between 1.5 to 2.5.
```{r}
library(lmtest)
dwtest(m1)
dwtest(m2)
dwtest(m3)
```

# 3. Homoscedasticity
To check Homoscedasticity, we use:

Scale-Location plot - the third plot in the diagnostic plots.
ncvTest
In Scale-Location Plot, we check to see if the red line is horizontal and residuals are equally spreaded. After seeing the plots, they all looked fine

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(m1,3)
plot(m2,3)
plot(m3,3)
```

# 4. Normality
To check normality, we use the Normal Q-Q plots - the second plot in the diagnostic plots. We check to see if the residuals follows the straight line.

Out of 3 models, the first model approximately follows the straight line while others may not.


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(m1,2)
plot(m2,2)
plot(m3,2)
```


-> Model Evaluation:


1) Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics. Common evaluation metrics for Linear Regression include:
    
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual sales.
   
    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual sales. It penalizes large errors more than MAE.
   
    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing error measurement in the same units as the target variable (sales).
   
    R squared: Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Higher R-squared values indicate a better fit.

-> Cross-Validation:

Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and robustness. This helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

-> Regularization (Optional):

Consider applying regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression if there are concerns about overfitting or multicollinearity among advertising spend variables.

-> Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):

If necessary, explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.


## -> Interpretation:

 ABOUT LINEAR REGRESSION:

1) Residuals:

Residuals represent the differences between the observed (actual) values and the predicted values by the model.
The summary shows statistics related to the residuals, including the minimum, 1st quartile (25th percentile), median (50th percentile), 3rd quartile (75th percentile), and maximum residual values.

2) Coefficients:

The coefficients section displays the estimated coefficients for the intercept and each of the independent variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper).
"Estimate" represents the estimated coefficient value for each variable.
"Std. Error" is the standard error associated with each coefficient estimate.
"t value" is the t-statistic, which measures the number of standard errors the estimated coefficient is away from zero. Larger absolute t values suggest more significant coefficients.
"Pr(>|t|)" is the p-value associated with each coefficient. Small p-values (typically < 0.05) indicate that the corresponding variable is statistically significant in predicting the dependent variable.

3) Residual standard error:

This is the estimated standard deviation of the residuals. It measures the average distance between the observed and predicted values. Smaller values indicate a better fit of the model to the data.

4) Multiple R-squared:

Multiple R-squared (R-squared) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Sales) that can be explained by the independent variables (TV, Radio, Newspaper).
In this case, the R-squared value is 0.9026, indicating that approximately 90.26% of the variance in Sales can be explained by the model.

5) Adjusted R-squared:

Adjusted R-squared adjusts the R-squared value based on the number of predictors in the model. It helps prevent overfitting. The adjusted R-squared value is 0.9011.

6) F-statistic:

The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model. A large F-statistic with a small p-value suggests that the overall model is significant.
In this case, the F-statistic is 605.4, with a p-value of less than 2.2e-16, indicating that the overall model is highly significant.

In summary, the Linear Regression model appears to be a good fit for the data. TV and Radio advertising expenditures are statistically significant predictors of Sales, as indicated by their low p-values. Newspaper advertising does not appear to be a significant predictor, as its coefficient is close to zero, and its p-value is high. The high R-squared value suggests that the model explains a substantial portion of the variance in Sales.

 ABOUT RMSE:
 
In this context, the RMSE value of 1.644994 means that, on average, your model's predictions for Sales have an error of approximately 1.644994 units when compared to the actual Sales values in your dataset.

A lower RMSE indicates that your model's predictions are closer to the actual values, and in this case, an RMSE of 1.644994 suggests that your model is performing quite well in terms of prediction accuracy.


-> Model Deployment:

Deploy the trained Linear Regression model into a production environment where it can make real-time or batch sales predictions based on advertising spend.

By following this approach, you can develop, train, and evaluate a Linear Regression model for sales forecasting in Marketing Analytics, allowing you to estimate sales based on advertising spend across multiple channels and make informed marketing decisions.



## Evaluation: 

Evaluating the performance of a predictive sales forecasting model is crucial to determine how well it captures the relationship between advertising spend and sales. Several metrics can be used to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness. The choice of evaluation metrics depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis.

Here are some commonly used metrics:

-> Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual sales values.
It provides a straightforward interpretation of the model's prediction accuracy.
MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.
MAE is appropriate when errors have a linear effect on the objective (e.g., cost).

-> Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual sales values.
It penalizes larger errors more than MAE, making it sensitive to outliers.
MSE is appropriate when errors should have a quadratic effect on the objective (e.g., minimizing error variance).

-> Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides error measurement in the same units as the target variable (sales).
It is interpretable in the original scale, making it useful for explaining the magnitude of prediction errors.

-> R-squared (R²):

R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
A higher R² indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.
It is essential to consider R-squared alongside other metrics to avoid overfitting.

-> Adjusted R-squared:

Adjusted R-squared adjusts R-squared for the number of predictors in the model.
It penalizes models with too many predictors, helping to prevent overfitting.
Higher adjusted R-squared values indicate better model fit, but the number of predictors should also be considered.

-> Cross-Validation:

Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and robustness.
Cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of a model's performance, especially when evaluating on a single testing dataset.
Metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² can be calculated for each fold and averaged to obtain a more accurate performance estimate.

-> Residual Analysis:

Examine the residuals (the differences between predicted and actual values) to assess the model's errors.
Plotting residuals can help identify patterns, such as heteroscedasticity or nonlinearity.
A well-behaved set of residuals suggests that the model assumptions are met.

The choice of metrics depends on the specific goals of the analysis and the nature of the problem. For example, if minimizing the absolute error in sales prediction is critical for cost management, MAE may be the preferred metric. If understanding the proportion of variance explained is essential, R-squared can be valuable.

In practice, it's often advisable to use a combination of these metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. Additionally, considering domain-specific factors and the business impact of prediction errors is crucial when selecting the most appropriate evaluation metrics.


## Advantages:

-> Model Interpretability: Some predictive models, especially complex ones like neural networks, can be challenging to interpret. Understanding the drivers behind predictions may be difficult.

-> External Factors: Predictive models may not account for all external factors that can impact sales, such as geopolitical events, natural disasters, or sudden changes in market sentiment.

-> Model Updates: Regular model updates are necessary to maintain accuracy over time. This requires ongoing data collection and model retraining, which can be resource-intensive.

-> Cost: Developing and implementing predictive analytics solutions can be costly, especially for smaller businesses without substantial budgets for technology and expertise.

-> Ethical Considerations: The use of predictive analytics raises ethical concerns related to data privacy and bias. Models must be built and used responsibly to avoid discriminatory outcomes.

-> Human Expertise: While predictive analytics can automate parts of the forecasting process, human expertise is still essential for data interpretation, model validation, and decision-making based on the forecasts.

In summary, predictive analytics offers significant advantages in sales forecasting, including improved accuracy and data-driven decision-making. However, it also presents challenges related to data quality, complexity, and model interpretability, among others. Successful implementation requires careful consideration of these factors and ongoing monitoring and adaptation to maintain effectiveness.


## Ethical Considerations:


Using predictive analytics in marketing raises several important ethical considerations, as it involves the collection, analysis, and utilization of consumer data for various purposes. Here are some ethical considerations in the context of predictive analytics in marketing:

-> Data Privacy:

Informed Consent: Marketers must ensure that consumers are aware of how their data is collected and used. Obtaining informed consent is critical, and consumers should have the option to opt in or opt out of data collection and tracking.
Data Security: Marketers are responsible for safeguarding the data they collect. Proper security measures must be in place to protect consumer information from breaches or unauthorized access.

-> Transparency:

Marketers should be transparent about their data practices and provide clear explanations of how predictive analytics is used to make decisions, personalize content, or target ads.
Transparent disclosure of the use of algorithms in decision-making is essential so that consumers understand how their interactions with digital platforms are influenced.

-> Fairness and Bias:

Predictive models can inadvertently perpetuate bias present in historical data. Marketers must actively address and mitigate biases in their algorithms to ensure fair treatment of all individuals, regardless of gender, race, age, or other protected attributes.
Ongoing monitoring and auditing of models for bias are essential to prevent discriminatory outcomes.

-> Deceptive Practices:

Marketers should not engage in deceptive practices, such as manipulating consumers through false advertising, fake reviews, or misleading claims based on predictive models.
Predictive analytics should be used to enhance the customer experience rather than deceive or manipulate.

-> Data Minimization:

Marketers should practice data minimization, collecting only the data necessary for their intended purposes. Unnecessary data collection can pose privacy risks and increase the potential for misuse.

-> Data Ownership:

Clarify data ownership and data sharing practices. Consumers should understand who owns the data they generate through their interactions with digital platforms, and how that data may be shared with third parties.

-> Algorithmic Transparency:

Ensure algorithmic transparency to the extent possible. While complex machine learning models may not be fully interpretable, marketers should strive to explain how they make decisions based on predictive analytics, especially in high-stakes contexts like lending or hiring.

-> Opt-Out Mechanisms:

Provide easy-to-use opt-out mechanisms. Consumers should have the ability to opt out of personalized advertising and data tracking if they choose to do so.

-> Use of Sensitive Data:

Avoid using sensitive personal information, such as medical records or financial data, for marketing purposes without explicit consent.

-> Consent for Profiling:

Profiling consumers based on their behavior or characteristics should only be done with their consent. This includes creating customer segments or profiles for targeted marketing.

-> Accountability and Governance:

Organizations should establish clear lines of accountability for ethical data practices and create governance frameworks to oversee data usage and model development.

-> Laws and Regulations:

Comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, that govern data privacy and consumer rights.

Ethical considerations in predictive analytics in marketing are essential to build and maintain trust with consumers. Marketers should prioritize responsible data practices, transparency, and fairness to ensure that predictive analytics benefits both businesses and individuals without compromising privacy or fairness.
